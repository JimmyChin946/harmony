### step 0: new things wee nee machine? (create the venv) with all the dependencies 
- install all of the dependencies
``` bash 
pip install tensorflow[and-cuda] numpy pandas requests Pillow scikit-learn keras-tuner opencv-python
```
- create the new .venv
``` bash 
python3 -m venv .venv
 ```

### step 1: Activate the venv
- if there is no .venv file in the directory, go to step 0
- activate the venv
``` bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
